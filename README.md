# PollDaddy Hack

Lansing State Journal Athlete of the Week Elections use PollDaddy
I wanted to vote for a specific athlete and let them win, so I wrote some code and scraped the internet for proxies.
You just need to change the poll id and person id and run this code (don't run it too much though) and it will automatically vote for the athlete you choose. If you want to make this code easy and fast, put it on repl.it and then share the link and people can execute it from their phones and you can vote at scale.
